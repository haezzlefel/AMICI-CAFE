          <h2> Cappuccino</h2>
          <p>A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam. Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.</p>

        <h2>Latte</h2>
        <p>A latte begins with the same base — a single or double shot of espresso. This espresso is then combined with several ounces of steamed milk to create a rich, creamy beverage that has a more subtle espresso taste.</p>

        <h2> Espresso</h2>
        <p>Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under 9–10 bars of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roast degrees.</p>

        <h2> Amerikano</h2>
        <p>The name came about during World War II when European baristas added water to their espresso drinks for the American soldiers stationed there. The resulting drink had a smoother, less concentrated flavour than espresso and thus the Americano was born.</p>

        <h2> Iced Coffee</h2>
        <p>Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee normally and then serving it over ice or in cold milk or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster</p>

        <h2> Frappe</h2>
        <p>The name frappé comes from French, where it describes drinks chilled with ice. Beginning in the 19th century, a variety of cold coffee drinks named café frappé (à la glace) are documented, some similar to slushes, others more like iced coffee.</p>
